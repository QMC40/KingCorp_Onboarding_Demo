===

bankers is a demonstration of my implementation of the banker's algorithm for resource usage and deadlock avoidance 

Currently it has the following limitations:

* must be compiled after 'module load gcc' to utilize most current version of gcc

* file name of test file should be added to run command to utilize it in demo i.e. './bankers test.txt'

* no none limitations in the scope of the assignment
